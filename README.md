## Usage

### Databases

You can create as many databases as you want. If you didn't create any database then
an `in memory database` will be used for your queries. In memory database will only execute
`SELECT` queries. Other statement types are not supported.

### Querying uploaded files

You can query the files using the following pattern:
```sql
-- example
-- if you have uploaded a file named `addresses.csv`
-- you can query it using the following query;
select * from '{{files}}/addresses.csv'
```
`{{files}}` are the base path of the uploaded files.

### Macros

You can create macros and use default macros on the sql scripts. Example to default macros are;

- `{{files}}` which resolves to data files base path
- `{{ref('script_name_without_extension')}}` which resolves to a sub-query that is the content of the script.

```sql

-- Example to {{files}}
select * from '{{files}}/addresses.csv''
-- Assuming you have a uploaded a data file named `addresses.csv`
-- Above script will resolve to the path of that file and will be something like;
-- select * from 'path/to/data-files/addresses.csv''

-- Example to {{ref}}
-- * Given that you have defined a macro like this in the `Macros` section in any file.:
{% macro greet(name) %}
  'Hello, {{ name }}!'
{% endmacro %}
-- * Given you have script file named 'demo.sql' which contains the following.
select {{ greet('Alice')}} as Greet, t.* from '{{files}}/addresses.csv' as t

-- * Given you have another script which contains the following SQL expression.
select * from {{ref('demo')}}

-- * This will resolve to
select * from
    (select
  'Hello, Alice!'
 as Greet, t.* from 'path/to/data-files/addresses.csv' as t)
```
